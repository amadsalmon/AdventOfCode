## Day 1: Secret Entrance ⏲

See [full puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1).

The puzzle involves a safe with a circular dial numbered 0–99, starting at 50. A list of rotations tells you how to turn it: each rotation has a direction (L for left, R for right) and a distance (number of clicks). The dial wraps around, so moving left from 0 goes to 99, and moving right from 99 goes to 0.

**Example input:**

```
L68
L30
R48
L5
```

### Part 1
Count how many times the dial ends up pointing at 0 after completing each rotation.

### Part 2
Count how many times the dial points at 0 during any rotation, not just at the end.
